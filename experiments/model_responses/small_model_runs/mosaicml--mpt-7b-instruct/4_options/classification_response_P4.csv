### Response:
A. I believe the following statement is false. ""Despite the severity of the impacts of Hurricane Maria, the Government of Puerto Rico initially reported that only 64 people died in the hurricane. Numerous media outlets harshly criticized the government for suppressing the true death toll."" I believe this statement is false because the government of Puerto Rico initially reported that only 64 people died in the hurricane, but the true death toll was likely much higher.
