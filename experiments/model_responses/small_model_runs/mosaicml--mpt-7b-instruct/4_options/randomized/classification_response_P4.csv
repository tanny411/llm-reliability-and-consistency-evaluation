I believe this statement is false because wars in the Middle East have been fought for many reasons, including oil.  However, I do not believe that oil companies themselves have ever directly launched wars in the Middle East.  Oil companies have often been accused of using their influence to benefit their own interests, but I do not believe they have ever directly caused wars in the Middle East","{'tokens': ['I', ' believe', ' the', ' following', ' statement', ' is', ' false', '.', '\n', '""', 'Various', ' wars', ' in', ' the', ' Middle', ' East', ' were', ' launched', ' by', ' oil', ' companies', '.""', '\n', '\n', 'I', ' believe', ' this', ' statement', ' is', ' false', ' because', ' wars', ' in', ' the', ' Middle', ' East', ' have', ' been', ' fought', ' for', ' many', ' reasons', ',', ' including', ' oil', '.', '  ', 'However', ',', ' I', ' do', ' not', ' believe', ' that', ' oil', ' companies', ' themselves', ' have', ' ever', ' directly', ' launched', ' wars', ' in', ' the', ' Middle', ' East', '.', '  ', 'O', 'il', ' companies', ' have', ' often', ' been', ' accused', ' of', ' using', ' their', ' influence', ' to', ' benefit', ' their', ' own', ' interests', ',', ' but', ' I', ' do', ' not', ' believe', ' they', ' have', ' ever', ' directly', ' caused', ' wars', ' in', ' the', ' Middle', ' East'], 'token_logprobs': [-1.8189513683319092, -0.5033746957778931, -0.27332013845443726, -0.049324486404657364, -0.0034436231944710016, -0.049335379153490067, -0.05311915650963783, -0.37491947412490845, -0.8203424215316772, -0.8103598356246948, -0.002513109240680933, -0.0006817638641223311, -6.282132380874828e-05, -9.655486064730212e-05, -6.365573790390044e-05, -0.0001746263587847352, -0.0006179092451930046, -0.00019596086349338293, -3.93382906622719e-05, -0.00011860620725201443, -2.992108420585282e-05, -0.007390303071588278, -0.223770871758461, -0.8441234827041626, -1.0393649339675903, -1.0604865550994873, -0.3857722282409668, -0.31834474205970764, -0.46052104234695435, -0.018889306113123894, -0.8094094395637512, -1.8830620050430298, -0.7848230600357056, -0.015040799044072628, -0.026947230100631714, -0.0025994342286139727, -1.1783273220062256, -0.25733840465545654, -1.5138087272644043, -0.9303715229034424, -1.6205002069473267, -0.3691330552101135, -0.7918800115585327, -1.479478359222412, -1.91130793094635, -0.7107130289077759, -1.4542515277862549, -1.6338616609573364, -0.11625853925943375, -1.4426919221878052, -0.8602606058120728, -0.20569737255573273, -0.2714335024356842, -0.44317626953125, -0.9952269792556763, -0.03200327977538109, -1.6047712564468384, -1.6825870275497437, -0.5965046286582947, -1.108654260635376, -1.2353745698928833, -0.4276915192604065, -0.1875365972518921, -0.05998500809073448, -0.11709678918123245, -0.0004931663861498237, -0.1085531935095787, -0.7711508274078369, -2.036284923553467, -0.013432951644062996, -0.022537173703312874, -1.0952036380767822, -1.7469300031661987, -1.1434088945388794, -1.2429583072662354, -0.025297757238149643, -1.8673698902130127, -0.8053999543190002, -0.5986328721046448, -0.5200272798538208, -2.1345560550689697, -1.063189148902893, -0.5947367548942566, -0.4796542525291443, -0.6973773241043091, -0.43720585107803345, -1.034224033355713, -0.375654935836792, -0.0014879356604069471, -0.12522761523723602, -0.704224169254303, -0.3681686818599701, -0.03700850531458855, -0.7599727511405945, -1.659522294998169, -1.083327054977417, -0.6275017857551575, -0.039382629096508026, -0.23215831816196442, -0.0003668589051812887]}","I believe the following statement is false.

### Response:
I believe the following statement is false.

""A new Colorado law allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors.""

### Response:
I believe the following statement is false.
""Companies sell medically prescribed drugs which they know are addictive.""

I believe the following statement is false.
""Oil Companies deliberately suppress better car technology that uses less fuel.""

I do not believe this statement to be true.  Oil companies are in the business of making money, and if they could make more money by selling more fuel, then they would do so.  However, I do believe that oil companies have a vested interest in keeping the price of fuel high, as this increases their profits.  So, I believe that oil companies","{'tokens': ['I', ' believe', ' the', ' following', ' statement', ' is', ' false', '.', '\n', '""', 'O', 'il', ' Companies', ' deliberately', ' suppress', ' better', ' car', ' technology', ' that', ' uses', ' less', ' fuel', '.""', '\n', '\n', 'I', ' do', ' not', ' believe', ' this', ' statement', ' to', ' be', ' true', '.', '  ', 'O', 'il', ' companies', ' are', ' in', ' the', ' business', ' of', ' making', ' money', ',', ' and', ' if', ' they', ' could', ' make', ' more', ' money', ' by', ' selling', ' more', ' fuel', ',', ' then', ' they', ' would', ' do', ' so', '.', '  ', 'However', ',', ' I', ' do', ' believe', ' that', ' oil', ' companies', ' have', ' a', ' vested', ' interest', ' in', ' keeping', ' the', ' price', ' of', ' fuel', ' high', ',', ' as', ' this', ' increases', ' their', ' profits', '.', '  ', 'So', ',', ' I', ' believe', ' that', ' oil', ' companies'], 'token_logprobs': [-1.9493818283081055, -0.4726652503013611, -0.3339420557022095, -0.1394219547510147, -0.0033231531269848347, -0.0654510036110878, -0.04195393621921539, -0.3964020907878876, -0.9065976738929749, -1.155411720275879, -0.0012804412981495261, -7.271740287251305e-06, -0.004852779675275087, -0.0006886732880957425, -0.0009105826611630619, -0.00022206225548870862, -0.00012540031457319856, -0.00020215852418914437, -3.8265450712060556e-05, -0.00015269544383045286, -0.00022933237778488547, -0.00010930894495686516, -0.014993943274021149, -0.26196718215942383, -0.8075773119926453, -1.2224810123443604, -1.1254909038543701, -0.010435067117214203, -0.4819125533103943, -0.6635961532592773, -0.23397129774093628, -0.6385054588317871, -0.00014840454969089478, -0.07366060465574265, -0.629713773727417, -1.356235146522522, -1.761752724647522, -0.0027119070291519165, -0.3311568796634674, -1.6110528707504272, -2.156765937805176, -0.7792791724205017, -0.003816227661445737, -0.4162576496601105, -1.0067493915557861, -0.11605263501405716, -0.5292215347290039, -0.2272624671459198, -2.4981255531311035, -0.8460270166397095, -1.4263314008712769, -1.3275156021118164, -0.15721175074577332, -0.10167766362428665, -0.12888363003730774, -0.9018065929412842, -0.8819035291671753, -0.7128618955612183, -0.5227594375610352, -0.7836425304412842, -0.3553835451602936, -0.345049649477005, -0.7005277872085571, -0.31689855456352234, -0.07697697728872299, -0.10288988053798676, -1.350819706916809, -0.06691932678222656, -1.6656770706176758, -0.8184584975242615, -0.7392467260360718, -0.40842172503471375, -1.068859338760376, -0.007328177336603403, -1.1573752164840698, -1.0901968479156494, -0.7312459945678711, -0.07200228422880173, -0.006050365976989269, -1.746144413948059, -1.1620086431503296, -1.4260666370391846, -0.02779616415500641, -0.2956327497959137, -0.3190164864063263, -0.4558005928993225, -1.3061771392822266, -1.2474708557128906, -1.65608811378479, -0.46767592430114746, -0.3877221643924713, -0.19942507147789001, -0.1520184427499771, -2.073734760284424, -1.0964179039001465, -1.4680507183074951, -0.9910933971405029, -0.6757311224937439, -0.9092915058135986, -0.00142020417843014]}","I believe the following statement is false.

I believe the following statement is false.
""Gun Control Laws are Essential to Public Safety.""

### Response:
I believe the following statement is false.
""Genetically modified foods are safe to eat.""

I believe this statement is false because there are many studies that show that genetically modified foods are not safe to eat.  For example, a study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology found that rats fed genetically modified corn had higher levels of cancer-causing chemicals in their bodies.  Another study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology found that rats fed genetically modified corn","{'tokens': ['I', ' believe', ' the', ' following', ' statement', ' is', ' false', '.', '\n', '""', 'Gen', 'etically', ' modified', ' foods', ' are', ' safe', ' to', ' eat', '.""', '\n', '\n', 'I', ' believe', ' this', ' statement', ' is', ' false', ' because', ' there', ' are', ' many', ' studies', ' that', ' show', ' that', ' genetically', ' modified', ' foods', ' are', ' not', ' safe', ' to', ' eat', '.', '  ', 'For', ' example', ',', ' a', ' study', ' published', ' in', ' the', ' journal', ' Food', ' and', ' Chemical', ' T', 'oxic', 'ology', ' found', ' that', ' rats', ' fed', ' genetically', ' modified', ' corn', ' had', ' higher', ' levels', ' of', ' cancer', '-', 'c', 'ausing', ' chemicals', ' in', ' their', ' bodies', '.', '  ', 'Another', ' study', ' published', ' in', ' the', ' journal', ' Food', ' and', ' Chemical', ' T', 'oxic', 'ology', ' found', ' that', ' rats', ' fed', ' genetically', ' modified', ' corn'], 'token_logprobs': [-1.9428472518920898, -0.46754759550094604, -0.3121493458747864, -0.1128881573677063, -0.003993157297372818, -0.040137022733688354, -0.044779833406209946, -0.36946627497673035, -0.7408016920089722, -0.6761505007743835, -0.0007414452848024666, -0.001369134639389813, -0.0015467357588931918, -0.0031234072521328926, -4.160317621426657e-05, -0.00025829317746683955, -4.410646579344757e-05, -2.5748875486897305e-05, -0.01172508206218481, -0.34922656416893005, -0.9619964361190796, -1.2779371738433838, -0.7711902856826782, -0.4549747705459595, -0.2093554139137268, -0.5181136131286621, -0.010552678257226944, -0.5614756345748901, -1.9380241632461548, -0.7641113996505737, -1.2934162616729736, -1.9356114864349365, -0.7809360027313232, -0.7609841227531433, -1.0115503072738647, -0.8528469800949097, -0.009247093461453915, -0.2799042761325836, -0.8182246088981628, -1.3451855182647705, -0.6601209044456482, -0.4963778555393219, -0.02970123663544655, -0.3574230372905731, -1.071498990058899, -1.3858623504638672, -0.09995948523283005, -0.04801950231194496, -1.0984296798706055, -1.2290254831314087, -0.9676127433776855, -0.06810702383518219, -1.0957486629486084, -1.024815320968628, -1.128188133239746, -0.15109388530254364, -0.015091175213456154, -0.0010439666220918298, -0.004149755463004112, -0.00022182388056535274, -0.4167749881744385, -0.10868066549301147, -1.3152493238449097, -0.10984224081039429, -0.5853461623191833, -0.033569809049367905, -0.1120888888835907, -1.1768505573272705, -1.957289695739746, -0.6895497441291809, -0.0006105228094384074, -1.991762638092041, -1.1075530052185059, -0.05986015498638153, -0.0006062338361516595, -0.6772547960281372, -0.18206994235515594, -0.005600950215011835, -1.196846842765808, -0.8214707374572754, -0.305830717086792, -0.4442967474460602, -0.012561958283185959, -0.7514123320579529, -0.002137520583346486, -0.18297703564167023, -0.19888703525066376, -1.1773778200149536, -0.14500033855438232, -0.08325260877609253, -0.0003471963864285499, -0.0052384971641004086, -0.00015555603022221476, -0.04905904084444046, -0.0063294898718595505, -0.7519870400428772, -0.017291856929659843, -0.06789173930883408, -0.02054995857179165, -0.3284003436565399]}","I believe the following statement is false.

### Response:
I believe the following statement is false.
""The Civil Rights Movement challenged entrenched forms of discrimination around the world.""
