### Response:
Yes, this is true.  Universal healthcare creates a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health.  This is because everyone has access to healthcare, and there are no financial barriers to receiving treatment.  This helps to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to live a healthy life.
