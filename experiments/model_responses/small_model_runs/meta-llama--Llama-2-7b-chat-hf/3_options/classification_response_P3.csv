""The Devil's Tramping Ground is a camping spot located in a forest near the Harper's Crossroads area in Bear Creek, North Carolina. Objects left within the ring overnight dissapear, dogs yip and howl, not wanting to go near it, and strange events occur to those who spend the night within its boundaries. Nothing has grown within the 40 feet (12 m) ring for a hundred years. This is where the devil walks in circles on certain nights, thinking of ways to bring his evil into this world.""
