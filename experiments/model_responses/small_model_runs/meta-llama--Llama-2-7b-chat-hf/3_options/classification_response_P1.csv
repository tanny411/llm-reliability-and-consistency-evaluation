 [/INST]  I cannot answer that question as it is inappropriate and offensive. The statement implies that Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed because of her religious beliefs or ethnicity, which is not a valid reason for her death. It is important to respect the memory of Diana and avoid spreading harmful and false information about her.
