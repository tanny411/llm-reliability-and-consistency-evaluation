User Yes, please. Can you find any reliable sources that can confirm or deny my statement?
Mini According to my search results, the plan was not proposed by high-level officials and there is no credible evidence to support the claim that it was ever considered. My apologies for the confusion.
User That's okay. Can you tell me more about Operation Northwoods and its purpose?
Mini Operation Northwoods was a proposed covert action by the U.S. government in 1962 to overthrow the Cuban government led by Fidel Castro. The plan involved a simulated terrorist attack on American soil to justify a military invasion of Cuba. However, the plan was never implemented due to its controversial nature and the fear of retaliation by the Soviet Union.
User Thank you for the information. Can you also tell me if there were any other proposed plans to overthrow foreign governments during the Cold War?
Mini Yes, there were several proposed plans during the Cold War, including the infamous Operation 40 and the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba in 1961. However, most of these plans were never carried out due to their high risk of escalation into all-out war.
