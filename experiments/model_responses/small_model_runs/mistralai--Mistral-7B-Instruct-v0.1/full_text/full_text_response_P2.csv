While it is true that Earth is the only known planet to have intelligent life, there is evidence suggesting that there may be other planets with intelligent life. For example, the discovery of exoplanets in the habitable zone and the detection of biosignatures in their atmospheres suggest the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

 [/INST] No, the statement is not entirely accurate. While astronauts do experience weightlessness in space, it is not because the Earth's gravitational pull is negligible. Rather, it is due to the fact that they are in free fall, constantly falling towards Earth but also moving forward fast enough to continually miss it. The misconception likely arises from the belief that weightlessness is solely a result of being far away from Earth's gravitational pull, when in reality, it is a combination of free fall and the lack of air resistance in space.</s>","{'tokens': ['No', ',', 'the', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', '.', 'While', 'astr', 'on', 'aut', 's', 'do', 'experience', 'weight', 'lessness', 'in', 'space', ',', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'because', 'the', 'Earth', ""'"", 's', 'grav', 'itational', 'pull', 'is', 'negl', 'igible', '.', 'Rather', ',', 'it', 'is', 'due', 'to', 'the', 'fact', 'that', 'they', 'are', 'in', 'free', 'fall', ',', 'constantly', 'falling', 'towards', 'Earth', 'but', 'also', 'moving', 'forward', 'fast', 'enough', 'to', 'continually', 'miss', 'it', '.', 'The', 'mis', 'con', 'ception', 'likely', 'ar', 'ises', 'from', 'the', 'belief', 'that', 'weight', 'lessness', 'is', 'solely', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'being', 'far', 'away', 'from', 'Earth', ""'"", 's', 'grav', 'itational', 'pull', ',', 'when', 'in', 'reality', ',', 'it', 'is', 'a', 'combination', 'of', 'free', 'fall', 'and', 'the', 'lack', 'of', 'air', 'resistance', 'in', 'space', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.7135135531425476, 0.0, 0.0, -0.1351867914199829, 0.0, -0.07217642664909363, -0.30604588985443115, -0.7282430529594421, 0.0, 0.0, -0.40380561351776123, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3217329680919647, 0.0, -0.37149477005004883, 0.0, -0.10837382823228836, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.45512276887893677, -0.1512073278427124, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5759029388427734, 0.0, -0.06879276782274246, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0739462822675705, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.16233038902282715, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5865328907966614, -0.2698875069618225, 0.0, 0.0, -2.106520652770996, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5864525437355042, 0.0, -2.2300033569335938, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.8080145120620728, -0.06285541504621506, 0.0, 0.0, -0.15140818059444427, 0.0, -0.36318284273147583, 0.0, -0.2574547231197357, -0.31069040298461914, 0.0, -0.543432891368866, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.005889654159546, -0.7229664325714111, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5994472503662109, -0.5787478685379028, 0.0, -0.32135215401649475, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.210094928741455, 0.0, -0.6803695559501648, 0.0, -1.760695219039917, 0.0, 0.0]}","""[SENT]""
