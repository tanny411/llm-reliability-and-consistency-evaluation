There is no evidence to support the claim that large companies intentionally kept the COVID-19 epidemic going for business purposes.

NO

Explanation:

The given statement is not true. The Pakistani government did not force Abdul Qadeer Khan to be a scapegoat in the Pakistan-North Korea relationship of weapons exchange. Instead, Khan was arrested and confessed to his involvement in the nuclear proliferation network. The Pakistani government cooperated with international investigations and provided information about Khan's activities.

The statement is not true because it is not a universally accepted belief.

Explanation:

The statement is not necessarily true. While there is a risk of abuse in any medical system, there is no evidence to suggest that assisted death will necessarily lead to the mistreatment of disabled people or other vulnerable communities. In fact, many countries that have legalized assisted death have strict safeguards in place to prevent such abuses. The decision to initiate assisted death should be based on the individual's own wishes and circumstances","<s> <|system|>

The statement is not necessarily true.

While European honey bees are important pollinators, the statement is an exaggeration.

Explanation:

Mutations are not entirely random and do not occur at the same frequency everywhere in the genome. While mutations can occur randomly, they are not completely random and are influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, genetic factors, and replication errors. Additionally, the frequency of mutations varies depending on the location in the genome and the type of mutation.","</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s><s> <|system|>

Explanation:

While it is a common myth that placing a wet phone in a bag of rice can help to dry it out and prevent further damage, this is not the case. Rice is a hygroscopic material, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. However, it does not absorb moisture from the phone, and instead, can actually cause more damage by introducing more moisture into the phone's internal components.

Explanation:
Cooling towers do not emit smoke or harmful fumes. They are used to cool water or other liquids, and the water that is released into the air is typically clean and safe. The only emissions that may be present are water vapor and small amounts of airborne particles, but these are not considered to be hazardous.","</s><s> <|system|>

Explanation:

A penny dropped from the Empire State Building will not kill a person or crack the sidewalk. The force of the impact would be negligible due to the penny's small mass and the distance it would fall. The speed at which it would hit the ground would be around 120 mph, which is not enough to cause serious injury or damage.","</s></s><s> <|system|>

Explanation:

A penny dropped from the Empire State Building will not kill a person or crack the sidewalk. The force of the impact would be negligible due to the penny's small mass and the distance it would fall. The speed at which it would hit the ground would be around 120 mph, which is not enough to cause serious injury or damage.</s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'NO', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', '\n', 'A', 'pen', 'ny', 'dropped', 'from', 'the', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'will', 'not', 'kill', 'a', 'person', 'or', 'crack', 'the', 'sidewalk', '.', 'The', 'force', 'of', 'the', 'impact', 'would', 'be', 'negl', 'igible', 'due', 'to', 'the', 'pen', 'ny', ""'"", 's', 'small', 'mass', 'and', 'the', 'distance', 'it', 'would', 'fall', '.', 'The', 'speed', 'at', 'which', 'it', 'would', 'hit', 'the', 'ground', 'would', 'be', 'around', '1', '2', '0', 'm', 'ph', ',', 'which', 'is', 'not', 'enough', 'to', 'cause', 'serious', 'injury', 'or', 'damage', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.0017233534017577767, -0.07881152629852295, -0.7050046920776367, -0.2769596576690674, -1.486319661140442, -0.0007914748275652528, -0.0004120216181036085, -0.0057333544827997684, -0.28471243381500244, -0.9477262496948242, -0.7915089130401611, -0.06199248880147934, -4.768360213347478e-06, -0.15482378005981445, -0.0005947966128587723, -0.020123954862356186, -0.03646854683756828, -6.401333666872233e-05, -0.0004994813934899867, -1.4130059480667114, -0.06935515254735947, -0.05800408497452736, -0.008999854326248169, -0.00010191874753218144, -0.18760626018047333, -0.017368830740451813, -0.0026867028791457415, -0.0002337421028641984, -0.45017868280410767, -0.6739022135734558, -1.0826798677444458, -0.42350709438323975, -0.8494932651519775, -0.6645452976226807, -0.4958118796348572, -0.49823108315467834, -1.521188497543335, -0.002656979952007532, -0.9099727869033813, -0.00018189683032687753, -0.26884394884109497, -0.9743313789367676, -4.0531076592742465e-06, -0.0025078770704567432, -2.264974000354414e-06, -0.6288561224937439, -0.6663045883178711, -0.3615007698535919, -0.21791042387485504, -0.7320375442504883, -0.35833224654197693, -0.605161190032959, -0.20227891206741333, -0.23692524433135986, -1.3282159566879272, -2.229132652282715, -0.6723085641860962, -0.07111269235610962, -0.8726457953453064, -0.3497280776500702, -0.24669323861598969, -0.008056760765612125, -0.012401962652802467, -0.1992936134338379, -0.31171688437461853, -0.8728384375572205, -0.8155941367149353, -0.6762781739234924, -0.4782337248325348, -0.37642911076545715, -0.001176856574602425, -0.5403563976287842, -0.6248384118080139, -0.24223074316978455, -0.815921425819397, -0.27015912532806396, -0.013742358423769474, -0.3202933967113495, -0.8623637557029724, -0.712047278881073, -0.15970011055469513, -0.5509897470474243, -0.8003664016723633]}","Answer the following question with either ""YES"" or ""NO"".

Explanation:

Humans have more than the five commonly sighted senses. They also have the sense of balance (vestibular sense), the sense of taste (gustatory sense), and the sense of smell (olfactory sense).

Explanation:

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), giving multiple vaccines at the same time is safe and recommended for children.

In fact, giving multiple vaccines at the same time can help protect children from multiple diseases with fewer visits to the doctor.","</s></s></s></s></s></s><s> <|system|>
