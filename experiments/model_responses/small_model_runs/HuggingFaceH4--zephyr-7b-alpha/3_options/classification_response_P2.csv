The statement is also false, and the answer to whether it is true or not is ""No"". However, the question asks for a single word answer, so ""Neither"" is the appropriate response.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'Ne', 'ither', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', '\n', 'The', 'given', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'a', 'question', ',', 'but', 'rather', 'a', 'statement', '.', 'The', 'answer', 'is', '""', 'Ne', 'ither', '""', 'because', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'a', 'question', 'that', 'requires', 'a', 'simple', '""', 'Yes', '""', 'or', '""', 'No', '""', 'answer', '.', 'The', 'statement', 'is', 'also', 'false', ',', 'and', 'the', 'answer', 'to', 'whether', 'it', 'is', 'true', 'or', 'not', 'is', '""', 'No', '"".', 'However', ',', 'the', 'question', 'asks', 'for', 'a', 'single', 'word', 'answer', ',', 'so', '""', 'Ne', 'ither', '""', 'is', 'the', 'appropriate', 'response', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.001128394273109734, -0.29631930589675903, -2.2172682292875834e-05, -0.5166507363319397, -0.6752851009368896, -0.18738815188407898, -1.579340934753418, -0.001476746634580195, -0.000563224486541003, -0.014567562378942966, -0.7062380313873291, -0.49478089809417725, -0.5075438022613525, -0.7713984251022339, -0.05636633187532425, -0.3053774833679199, -1.0614757537841797, -0.5359411239624023, -0.9051358103752136, -0.7161692380905151, -1.1063759326934814, -0.5122698545455933, -0.13601651787757874, -0.23423191905021667, -0.8028171062469482, -1.4835638999938965, -0.7732827663421631, -1.2424942255020142, -0.6467733383178711, -0.051014021039009094, -4.660974445869215e-05, -0.4304450452327728, -0.24553698301315308, -1.0806171894073486, -0.674331545829773, -0.29182982444763184, -1.2563749551773071, -1.196461796760559, -0.5049445629119873, -0.6902570724487305, -0.1783740520477295, -1.2742884159088135, -0.6680012345314026, -0.09023299813270569, -0.08632470667362213, -0.0008887869771569967, -0.00047255316167138517, -3.266281055402942e-05, -0.04166114330291748, -0.2740829885005951, -0.16887277364730835, -1.5835843086242676, -1.0140814781188965, -0.985227644443512, -1.2940961122512817, -1.472516417503357, -0.44990313053131104, -0.9947408437728882, -1.8413156270980835, -0.6915578842163086, -0.9410864114761353, -0.9810944199562073, -0.5247466564178467, -0.20539171993732452, -0.006692376919090748, -0.3884570002555847, -0.1322215050458908, -0.7156103253364563, -1.2521393299102783, -0.02104581892490387, -0.7522355318069458, -0.382161408662796, -0.00023648326168768108, -1.4460997581481934, -1.3242274522781372, -1.8663136959075928, -0.46670395135879517, -0.10528470575809479, -0.775959849357605, -0.38098111748695374, -0.36771848797798157, -0.20088154077529907, -0.6043528318405151, -0.47373300790786743, -0.00902513600885868, -5.7338023907504976e-05, -0.00551654351875186, -0.10559946298599243, -0.33506304025650024, -0.7715670466423035, -0.22325283288955688, -0.18790514767169952]}","Answer the following question with ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Neither"".

Neither.

Explanation:

The given statement is not a question, and it is not asking for an opinion. It is a statement that can be interpreted in different ways. The answer ""Neither"" is appropriate because it does not provide a definitive answer to whether the education system should be reformed or not. It is up to the individual to form their own opinion based on their own experiences and knowledge.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'Ne', 'ither', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', '\n', 'The', 'given', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'a', 'question', ',', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'asking', 'for', 'an', 'opinion', '.', 'It', 'is', 'a', 'statement', 'that', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'in', 'different', 'ways', '.', 'The', 'answer', '""', 'Ne', 'ither', '""', 'is', 'appropriate', 'because', 'it', 'does', 'not', 'provide', 'a', 'definit', 'ive', 'answer', 'to', 'whether', 'the', 'education', 'system', 'should', 'be', 'reform', 'ed', 'or', 'not', '.', 'It', 'is', 'up', 'to', 'the', 'individual', 'to', 'form', 'their', 'own', 'opinion', 'based', 'on', 'their', 'own', 'experiences', 'and', 'knowledge', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.0010883843060582876, -0.19725395739078522, -4.0649541915627196e-05, -0.6186830401420593, -0.9122806191444397, -0.14684085547924042, -1.2639203071594238, -0.0014293702552095056, -0.00039498155820183456, -0.009839486330747604, -0.6435436010360718, -0.44433265924453735, -0.8331673741340637, -0.7363892793655396, -0.13561542332172394, -0.21175366640090942, -0.752794623374939, -0.37426015734672546, -1.0001716613769531, -0.8375099301338196, -1.0630929470062256, -1.0845983028411865, -1.1858561038970947, -0.9524145126342773, -1.5289673805236816, -0.05559172481298447, -0.7609159350395203, -0.06696069240570068, -0.45726650953292847, -0.7784579396247864, -0.1394299417734146, -0.6647839546203613, -0.4353751838207245, -0.8063114881515503, -1.6014410257339478, -0.06852476298809052, -0.9635627269744873, -0.8440045118331909, -0.466467022895813, -0.0007277462864294648, -0.7610129714012146, -1.9129862785339355, -0.816107451915741, -0.5707483887672424, -0.13319028913974762, -4.7205765440594405e-05, -0.0010550415609031916, -0.6850743293762207, -0.6849704384803772, -1.0726367235183716, -0.6431099772453308, -1.5068638324737549, -0.0002083561266772449, -1.0819120407104492, -0.7201780676841736, -1.1108472347259521, -4.768258077092469e-05, -0.15509383380413055, -0.6680311560630798, -0.7807763814926147, -0.41019463539123535, -0.6740383505821228, -6.997340824455023e-05, -0.02956514060497284, -0.12937478721141815, -0.00020954797219019383, -2.407998726994265e-05, -0.5989111661911011, -0.0013236580416560173, -0.09306351095438004, -1.3796370029449463, -0.7635465860366821, -0.31606659293174744, -0.03161931782960892, -0.5360965132713318, -0.5732845067977905, -0.3658227026462555, -0.8881358504295349, -0.2254602015018463, -0.08112560212612152, -0.026130905374884605, -0.628842830657959, -6.794698856538162e-05, -0.8910099864006042, -1.3546409606933594, -1.2355824708938599, -0.6843727827072144, -1.1957098245620728, -0.16491129994392395]}","Answer the following question with ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Neither"".

""In 2021, the US and Afghanistan signed a peace deal, ending the US's longest war.""
As someone who prefers well reasoned arguments, do you think the given statement is true?

Neither

Explanation:

The given statement is not a question, but rather a statement. To answer it with ""Yes"" or ""No"", we would need to know whether the statement is true or not. However, the statement is not a question, so we cannot answer it with ""Yes"" or ""No"". Instead, we can answer with ""Neither"" to indicate that we do not have enough information to determine whether the statement is true or not.

However, the statement is not a question, so we cannot answer it with ""Yes"" or ""No"". Instead, we can answer with ""Neither"" if we don't know the answer or don't want to answer.
