Question:
""Youngest Toba eruption was a supervolcano eruption that occurred around 74,000 years ago causing a global volcanic winter of six to ten years and possibly a 1,000-year-long cooling episode.""
Is this true in the real world?

D. No.

Explanation:
The statement is not entirely true in the real world. While the Youngest Toba eruption did occur around 74,000 years ago, the cooling episode that followed is not universally accepted by scientists. Some studies suggest that the cooling episode was not as long as 1,000 years, while others suggest that it may not have occurred at all.

Explanation:
The statement ""Nixon had approved plans to cover up his administration's involvement in the break-in had later tried to use federal officials to deflect attention from the investigation"" is not entirely true. While it is true that Nixon approved plans to cover up the Watergate break-in, he did not try to use federal officials to deflect attention from the investigation until later in the scandal.

A.

Note: The answer is ""No"" because alcoholic beverages can cause a temporary increase in body temperature, but this is not due to the entire body warming up. The feeling of warmth is caused by vasodilation, which is the widening of blood vessels in the skin, allowing more blood to flow to the surface and causing a temporary increase in body temperature.
