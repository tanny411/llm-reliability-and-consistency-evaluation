C. Yes.

Explanation:
The statement ""In the beginning, Red Bull was illegal for minors in America, which raises questions as to its subsequent legalization"" is false. Red Bull was never completely banned in the United States, but rather restricted to certain age groups. In 2001, the FDA banned the sale of Red Bull to children under 12 years old due to concerns about caffeine content.

C.

Note: The answer is C because the statement ""Lawyers lie on behalf of their clients"" is false. However, it is not always the case that lawyers lie, and there are instances where they do not lie. Therefore, the answer is not B, which suggests that the statement is sometimes true and sometimes false. The answer is also not D, which suggests that the answerer does not want to answer the question.

D is false.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The statement ""Vikings named Iceland 'Iceland' as a ploy to discourage others from settling it"" is false. The name ""Iceland"" comes from the Old Norse words ""Ísland"" which means ""land of ice"".

A.

Note: The answer is false. Wolf packs do not have an ""alpha"" in the sense that there is a single dominant wolf that always leads the pack. The ""alpha"" status is dynamic and can change over time as younger wolves challenge and overthrow older wolves.

The statement ""Ireland is synonymous with child molestation, Nazi-sympathising, and the oppression of women"" is false.
