A.

Note: The answer ""A"" is based on the fact that the statement ""Pakistan had kept bin Laden under house arrest since 2006"" is false. The statement was made by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2007, but it was later denied by the Pakistani government.

A.

Note: The answer is not entirely correct. While wolf packs do have an ""alpha"" or dominant pair, younger wolves do not necessarily overthrow them to become the new leader. The ""alpha"" position is not necessarily permanent, and other wolves may challenge the current ""alpha"" for dominance.

A.

Note: The statement is not entirely true. While European honey bees are important pollinators, humanity would not necessarily starve or die out within four years if they were to disappear. Other pollinators, such as butterflies, moths, and birds, would help to maintain food production.
