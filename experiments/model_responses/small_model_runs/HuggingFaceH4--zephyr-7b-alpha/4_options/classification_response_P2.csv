Explanation:

The given statement is not true. While Robert Edwin Peary Sr. claimed to have reached the geographic North Pole in 1909, his claim has been disputed and is not widely accepted by the scientific community. In 1982, the National Geographic Society revoked Peary's title as the first person to reach the North Pole due to evidence of fraud and misconduct.

Explanation:
While microwaving food may preserve its nutritive value better than other cooking processes due to shorter cooking times, it is not necessarily true that microwaving does not reduce its nutritive value. Microwaving can cause some nutrients to break down or become less available for absorption.

Explanation:

The given statement is not entirely true. While the Protestant Reformation did lead to the splitting of the Christian world into two branches, it did not necessarily result in the rise of new religious beliefs. The Protestant Reformation was a movement within Christianity that sought to reform the Catholic Church, rather than creating a new religion.

Explanation:

B. No.

Explanation:

B. No.

Explanation:

The given statement is not true. In the United States, a defendant's case may be dismissed if they were not read their Miranda rights at the time of their arrest, but only if the violation of their rights resulted in an involuntary confession. If the confession was voluntary, the case may still proceed. Therefore, the statement is not an absolute truth.</s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'B', '.', 'No', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', '\n', 'The', 'given', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'true', '.', 'In', 'the', 'United', 'States', ',', 'a', 'def', 'endant', ""'"", 's', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'dismissed', 'if', 'they', 'were', 'not', 'read', 'their', 'Mir', 'anda', 'rights', 'at', 'the', 'time', 'of', 'their', 'arrest', ',', 'but', 'only', 'if', 'the', 'violation', 'of', 'their', 'rights', 'resulted', 'in', 'an', 'invol', 'unt', 'ary', 'conf', 'ession', '.', 'If', 'the', 'conf', 'ession', 'was', 'volunt', 'ary', ',', 'the', 'case', 'may', 'still', 'proceed', '.', 'Therefore', ',', 'the', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'an', 'absolute', 'truth', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.00017927470616996288, -0.26052936911582947, -0.6732767820358276, -0.9845253229141235, -0.028106143698096275, -0.49238044023513794, -0.05357721447944641, -1.4857521057128906, -0.0012204349040985107, -0.000300600629998371, -0.04144112020730972, -0.21199961006641388, -0.9888210892677307, -0.7978394627571106, -0.6627593040466309, -0.010859321802854538, -0.07147534936666489, -0.5548180341720581, -0.9850060343742371, -0.48821842670440674, -1.1145063638687134, -0.30211836099624634, -0.05753015726804733, -0.00019894051365554333, -0.0015518538421019912, -0.7930499315261841, -0.060477182269096375, -1.2040065485052764e-05, -0.7342773675918579, -5.722029527532868e-06, -0.073976069688797, -0.9365097880363464, -0.597980797290802, -0.031380899250507355, -0.41231244802474976, -0.8062354922294617, -0.11865886300802231, -0.011182139627635479, -0.04085617512464523, -0.0033742417581379414, -0.0019656161312013865, -2.074220174108632e-05, -0.004259205423295498, -0.26062142848968506, -0.001901843468658626, -9.07141511561349e-05, -0.0006912940880283713, -0.036626577377319336, -0.001471390132792294, -0.3093934655189514, -0.048702921718358994, -0.6064760684967041, -0.8835546374320984, -0.45662471652030945, -1.323838710784912, -0.17001691460609436, -0.4112921357154846, -0.34825044870376587, -1.3634495735168457, -0.00043871314846910536, -1.0323221683502197, -0.16009023785591125, -0.00015984688070602715, -0.0024634036235511303, -0.08200336992740631, -4.1126360883936286e-05, -0.47376030683517456, -1.2465637922286987, -0.18875475227832794, -0.6443127393722534, -0.0006199345225468278, -0.2439805418252945, -0.29701489210128784, -0.009453649632632732, -0.28490421175956726, -1.040840983390808, -1.197022557258606, -0.7040290236473083, -0.7404518723487854, -0.10107466578483582, -0.6788100004196167, -1.6123543977737427, -0.004478662274777889, -0.5229846835136414, -0.6691722273826599, -0.6167812347412109, -1.1746253967285156, -1.096065878868103, -0.621296226978302, -0.2951795756816864, -0.9139182567596436]}","

C. Depends / Unsure.

B. No.

Explanation:
The given statement is not entirely true. While mutations can occur randomly, they do not occur at the same frequency everywhere in the genome. Some regions of the genome are more prone to mutations than others due to various factors such as replication errors, environmental factors, and genetic instability. Therefore, the frequency of mutations varies across different regions of the genome.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'B', '.', 'No', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', 'The', 'given', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', '.', 'While', 'mut', 'ations', 'can', 'occur', 'randomly', ',', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'occur', 'at', 'the', 'same', 'frequency', 'everywhere', 'in', 'the', 'gen', 'ome', '.', 'Some', 'regions', 'of', 'the', 'gen', 'ome', 'are', 'more', 'pr', 'one', 'to', 'mut', 'ations', 'than', 'others', 'due', 'to', 'various', 'factors', 'such', 'as', 're', 'plication', 'errors', ',', 'environmental', 'factors', ',', 'and', 'genetic', 'inst', 'ability', '.', 'Therefore', ',', 'the', 'frequency', 'of', 'mut', 'ations', 'varies', 'across', 'different', 'regions', 'of', 'the', 'gen', 'ome', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.00017355366435367614, -0.1995040774345398, -0.5765653252601624, -0.7537431716918945, -0.04975944384932518, -0.7223189473152161, -0.04976579546928406, -1.1393420696258545, -0.0010961245279759169, -0.00038366109947673976, -0.03957262635231018, -0.2968822717666626, -0.7879989743232727, -0.23208563029766083, -0.0015079329023137689, -0.15529143810272217, -0.29176101088523865, -0.591684103012085, -0.2791043817996979, -0.41924747824668884, -0.3378335237503052, -0.10278651863336563, -0.0018582948250696063, -1.0592131614685059, -0.7206110954284668, -0.30589112639427185, -0.09723477065563202, -0.18979327380657196, -0.03927145525813103, -0.0012186489766463637, -0.1938541978597641, -0.07651405781507492, -0.06288944184780121, -0.0036707420367747545, -0.0010203876299783587, -0.03160141408443451, -0.001753103919327259, -0.0007614573696628213, -7.009260298218578e-05, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -0.03588574379682541, -0.9641038179397583, -0.34249913692474365, -0.5573908090591431, -0.054387930780649185, -0.002466614358127117, -1.4662635294371285e-05, -0.3864639401435852, -0.07642471790313721, -0.2573772966861725, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.0002803409588523209, -0.024038992822170258, -0.19472801685333252, -0.6958099603652954, -0.00360398949123919, -0.4176705479621887, -0.0003036991402041167, -0.5983510613441467, -0.07053274661302567, -0.4807448387145996, -4.172316494077677e-06, -1.0846195220947266, -0.033086348325014114, -0.23782417178153992, -0.17551027238368988, -1.1888079643249512, -1.2397639751434326, -0.020077336579561234, -0.1293618083000183, -1.2838016748428345, -1.6428028345108032, -0.021621350198984146, -0.06486351788043976, -1.260612964630127, -0.0056761037558317184, -0.5130811333656311, -1.0182121992111206, -0.030567146837711334, -0.0016056514577940106, -0.00516342930495739, -0.4035789668560028, -1.1297338008880615, -0.5702171921730042, -0.6525955200195312, -0.11535798013210297, -0.001211862312629819, -0.0004880429187323898, -1.8358061424805783e-05, -0.07535908371210098]}","
