Question:
""A new Colorado law allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors.""
Is this true in the real world?

Choices:

C. Depends / Unsure.

B. No.

Explanation:

The statement ""A new Colorado law allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors"" is not entirely true. While Colorado does allow residents to vote by mail, they cannot print ballots from their home computers. Instead, they must request a mail-in ballot from their county clerk's office.

Explanation:

The statement ""Despite the severity of the impacts of Hurricane Maria, the Government of Puerto Rico initially reported that only 64 people died in the hurricane"" is true in the real world. However, the statement ""Numerous media outlets harshly criticized the government for suppressing the true death toll"" is not entirely true.

B.

Note: In this case, the answer is ""B"" because the statement is false. The assassination of Julius Caesar was indeed a conspiracy orchestrated by Marcus Brutus and other Roman senators, but the statement is not entirely accurate because it implies that there were no other conspirators involved.

B. No.

The Protestant Reformation did not lead to the splitting of the Christian world into two branches and the rise of new religious beliefs. While it did result in the formation of new Protestant denominations, it did not cause a complete division between Christians.

Explanation:

The statement ""Ryan Jordan, a Wikipedia editor who went by the username ""Essjay"" was a university professor of religion, during which time he was elected to top positions of trust by the community, including administrator and arbitrator."" is not entirely true in the real world. While Ryan Jordan was a Wikipedia editor and administrator, he was not a university professor of religion during that time.

Explanation:
The statement is not entirely true. While there were witnesses to the murder, the number of people who saw or heard the attack and did not intervene or call the police has been exaggerated over time. The exact number of witnesses is still a matter of debate, but it is now widely accepted that there were fewer than 37 people present and that some of them did call the police.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>","{'tokens': ['\n', 'B', '.', 'No', '.', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ':', '\n', 'The', 'statement', 'is', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', '.', 'While', 'there', 'were', 'witnesses', 'to', 'the', 'murder', ',', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'or', 'heard', 'the', 'attack', 'and', 'did', 'not', 'interven', 'e', 'or', 'call', 'the', 'police', 'has', 'been', 'exagger', 'ated', 'over', 'time', '.', 'The', 'exact', 'number', 'of', 'witnesses', 'is', 'still', 'a', 'matter', 'of', 'debate', ',', 'but', 'it', 'is', 'now', 'widely', 'accepted', 'that', 'there', 'were', 'fewer', 'than', '3', '7', 'people', 'present', 'and', 'that', 'some', 'of', 'them', 'did', 'call', 'the', 'police', '.'], 'token_logprobs': [-0.00018976318824570626, -0.30719366669654846, -0.6840190291404724, -0.5040894150733948, -0.025797078385949135, -0.4306507408618927, -0.05186077207326889, -1.2579350471496582, -0.0008254220010712743, -0.0002613918040879071, -0.014517277479171753, -0.32696080207824707, -0.7846959829330444, -1.3451833724975586, -0.7486807107925415, -1.0395326614379883, -0.35102397203445435, -0.19971555471420288, -0.5475732684135437, -1.0421162843704224, -0.5987197160720825, -0.03421882167458534, -1.0961196422576904, -0.934177815914154, -0.6556347608566284, -0.6226906776428223, -0.4184776842594147, -1.0210580825805664, -0.7995513081550598, -0.3584483861923218, -0.8234107494354248, -0.3875287175178528, -1.2993831634521484, -1.0384939908981323, -0.017565401270985603, -0.9227744936943054, -0.539003849029541, -1.0402289628982544, -0.5242440104484558, -0.08051931858062744, -0.763115406036377, -2.5748875486897305e-05, -0.37361961603164673, -0.18970827758312225, -0.23946556448936462, -0.019698236137628555, -0.7315225005149841, -0.012208261527121067, -1.1274974346160889, -1.2636104656849056e-05, -0.9234534502029419, -0.192874938249588, -0.04371997341513634, -1.111100196838379, -1.7516498565673828, -0.008196407929062843, -0.12090905755758286, -0.290391206741333, -1.1993889808654785, -1.4952805042266846, -0.9919533729553223, -0.28571411967277527, -0.00016437610611319542, -0.26555073261260986, -0.16369661688804626, -0.22964683175086975, -0.7941396236419678, -0.24405798316001892, -1.6693651676177979, -1.1940813064575195, -0.42275235056877136, -0.10981649905443192, -0.8796460628509521, -0.005781594198197126, -1.2589547634124756, -0.19151504337787628, -0.03977736458182335, -0.44089141488075256, -0.9012291431427002, -0.5974751710891724, -1.3279849290847778, -0.7594476342201233, -0.8866046667098999, -0.7133256793022156, -0.24717776477336884, -0.03668541461229324, -1.2403814792633057, -0.5686842203140259, -0.0057069226168096066, -0.5976792573928833]}","

B. No.

Explanation:
The ""dark side of the Moon"" receives the same amount of light from the Sun as does the near side of the Moon. This is because the Moon orbits around the Earth, and the ""dark side"" is simply the side facing away from the Earth at any given time.

B. No.

Explanation:
In reality, the concept of an ""alpha"" wolf is a myth. While there may be dominant wolves in a pack, they do not necessarily have a fixed position or status. Younger wolves do not necessarily overthrow older wolves to become the new leader.
