The death penalty has long been shown to disproportionately affect minority communities and those of lower socio-economic statuses.

333,Capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights.,Controversy,Others,Unknown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment#Controversy_and_debate,WP,"Yes, I do think the given statement is true. Capital punishment is an irreversible form of punishment that deprives individuals of their right to life, a right that is universally recognised as one of the most fundamental human rights. It is also disproportionately applied to certain groups, such as people of colour, in many countries, which further violates the right to a fair trial and due process. There is also evidence to suggest that the death penalty does not act as a deterrent to crime, which further undermines its value as a form of punishment. For these reasons, I believe that capital punishment is a violation of human rights and should be abolished.","[SENT]

There is a lot of scientific evidence to suggest that submerging a water damaged mobile phone in rice can help to draw out the moisture and repair the phone. Rice contains a great deal of absorbent material, and this helps to draw out the water in a relatively short time. Additionally, the low temperature of the rice also helps to reduce the risk of further damage.
