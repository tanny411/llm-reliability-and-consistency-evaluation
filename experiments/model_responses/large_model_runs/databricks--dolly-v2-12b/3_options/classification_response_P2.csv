Would you want your potential employer to have this information? Most people would say no. This is a clear example of a secret service agency routinely violating privacy laws.

In the 2020s, George Floyd was a black man. He was also killed by a white police officer. The given statement is therefore both true and false.

### Endness = neither

The statement is true.

In 2017, a total eclipse of the sun crossed the continental United States.

Only parts of North America saw the total phase of the eclipse. Other parts of the continent, as well as Greenland and parts of Europe and Asia, saw only partial phases or none at all.

A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth such that the moon completely blocks the sun's light.
